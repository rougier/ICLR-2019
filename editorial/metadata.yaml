abstract: "The Second Edition of ICLR Reproducibility Challenge is an open, peer-reviewed, collaborative experiment in evaluating Replicability and Reproducibility of Machine Learning articles submitted to top conferences, this time in International Conference of Learning Representations (ICLR), May 2019. We conduct the challenge through Fall 2018 on submitted papers in this conference, and in this special issue of ReScience journal we present the peer-reviewed selected reports."
