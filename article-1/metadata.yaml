abstract: "In this paper, we present a reproduction of the paper of
          Bertinetto et al. [1] ”Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form
          solvers” as part of the ICLR 2019 Reproducibility Challenge. In
          successfully reproducing the most crucial part of the paper, we reach
          a performance that is comparable with or superior to the original
          paper on two benchmarks for several settings. We evaluate new baseline
          results, using a new dataset presented in the paper. Yet, we also
          provide multiple remarks and recommendations about reproducibility and
          comparability. After we brought our reproducibility work to the
          authorsʼ attention, they have updated the original paper on which this
          work is based and released code as well. Our contributions mainly
          consist in reproducing the most important results of their original
          paper, in giving insight in the reproducibility and in providing a
          first open-source implementation."
